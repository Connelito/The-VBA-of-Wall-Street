## Summary

I will use VBA scripting to analyze [stock market data](Resources/2014-2016_stock_data.xlsx) while developing my scripts to generate a [final report](Resources/2014-2016_stock_data_formatted.xlsx).

### Retrival of Data, Column Creation and Conditional Formatting

  ![Stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following:

  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.

I also utilized conditional formatting that will highlight positive yearly changes in green and negative yearly changes in red by creating a VBA script that ran on every worksheet just by running the VBA script once.

* These are the results.
